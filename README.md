## Bruh esoteric programming language
Have you ever coded something and said "bruh"? Then this is for you!
Bruh will make you bruh when you code it.

### Syntax

Every program must start with ```moment```
This will reset all variables to 0. It can be used later in code to reset variables.

Bruh has 3 variables: ```bruh.```, ```bruh!``` and ```bruh?```

There are 5 ways of modifing their values:

```bruh. momentum``` - increase the variable by one

```bruh. moment``` - decrease the varianle by one
 
```bruh. bruh!``` - assign another variable 

```bruh. momentum bruh!``` - increase the variable by another variable

```bruh. moment bruh!``` - decrease the variable by another variable


Outputting variables:

```moment bruh.``` - Output the variable as an integer

```momentum bruh.``` - Convert the integer to ASCII and output it


While loops:

```sound bruh. bruh?``` - Loop until ```bruh.``` is equal to ```bruh?```

```sound bruh. momentum bruh?``` - Loop until ```bruh.``` is bigger than```bruh?```

```sound bruh. moment bruh?``` - Loop until ```bruh.``` is smaller than ```bruh?```

```effect``` - End of a while loop

**While loops can't contain other while loops!**

Example loop:

```
moment
bruh? momentum
bruh? momentum

sound bruh. momentum bruh?
bruh. momentum
effect

moment bruh.
```
