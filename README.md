## Bruh esoteric programming language
Have you ever coded something and said "bruh"? Then this is for you!
Bruh will make you bruh when you code it.

### Syntax

Every program must start with ```moment```
This will reset all variables to 0. It can be used later in code to reset variables.

Bruh has 3 variables: ```bruh.```, ```bruh!``` and ```bruh?```

There are 5 ways of modifing their values:

```bruh. moment``` - increase the variable by one

```bruh. momentum``` - decrease the varianle by one
 
```bruh. bruh!``` - assign another variable 

```bruh. momentum bruh!``` - increase the variable by another variable

```bruh. momentum bruh!``` - decrease the variable by another variable
